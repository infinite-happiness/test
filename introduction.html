<h2>Happiness</h2>
Ánanda Márga is the socio-spiritual path of bliss — infinite happiness. The path consists of mainly two endeavors: Self-Realization and the Welfare of the Universe. In other words, it’s not only about expanding your mind through spiritual techniques, but also about contributing and doing as much as you can for the benefit and advancement of society and other beings.
